# General Bioinformatics Scripts

This repository includes the following kinds of scripts:

- Scripts used to reformat typical sequence data files such as fasta files and gff files.
- Scripts used to analyse features of biological sequences.

Most of the reformatting scripts are semi-portable, i.e. they may require some pre-emptive formatting by the user.
They should take care of the tricky bits that would be impractical to attempt to do manually.
