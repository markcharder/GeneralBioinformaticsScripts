# General Bioinformatics Scripts

This repository includes the following kinds of scripts:

- Portable scripts used to reformat typical sequence data files such as fasta files and gff files.
- Portable scripts used to analyse features of biological sequences.
- Scripts specifically used for the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum genome project that are only portable if one had followed exactly the same procedures as our lab beforehand.
